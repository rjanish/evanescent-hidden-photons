# A coarse sampling of j_eff in a cylindrical shell surrounding the
# entire cavity, for a propagating and evanescent mass.

# The purpose of this is to test the direction of j_eff, rotational
# symmetry and parity about cavity center, and check the qualitative
# structure

mode        TE011  # rotationally symmetric mode

radius      10.0
length      0.5

# frequency of TE011 R=1, L=0.02 is 1570.8
